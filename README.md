# EatDaBurgerApp
My version of the EatDaBurger app assignment.

## What Does My APP Do?

* When the user first gets onto the website, they are shown a pre-set list of burgers on the screen. There is also an empty list on the right side, *DEVOURED:*, and a submit bar on the bottom of the page if the user wants to add in a burger that they'd like to eat.

* If the user clicks *'DEVOUR IT!*, it will bring the corresponding burger into the *DEVOURED* list on the right side. Additionally, if the user created any new burgers, they can devour those as well by clicking the button attached to the burger.
